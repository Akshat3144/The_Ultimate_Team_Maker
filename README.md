This project is a C++ program that generates balanced teams based on user-provided data. It aims to create fair and diverse teams by considering various skills and attributes of individuals.

## Features

- Collect user data such as names, skills, and attributes
- Categorize skills into different categories (e.g., technical, analytical, creative)
- Assign weights to different skill categories based on importance
- Generate teams using different algorithms:
  - Random Team Generator: Assigns individuals randomly to teams
  - Categorical Team Generator: Assigns individuals to teams based on their scores in different skill categories
- Print teams with or without individual scores
- Search and sort teams based on a specific skill category

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to provide input data (names and skills) or load from a file.
4. Choose the desired team generation algorithm.
5. Specify the number of teams to create.
6. View the generated teams and their members.
7. Optionally, print teams to the console or save them to a file.

## File Formats

The program supports reading and writing data to/from CSV files. The expected format for input files is:

```
Name,Skill1,Skill2,Skill3,...
John Doe,5,4,3,...
Jane Smith,2,4,5,...
...
```

## Dependencies

This project uses the following C++ libraries:

- `<iostream>`
- `<fstream>`
- `<vector>`
- `<queue>`
- `<map>`
- `<algorithm>`
- `<random>`

## PS - Front-end already done, Working on Back-end.
